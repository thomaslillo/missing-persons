    "CaseDesc": "During the early morning hours of Friday, October 1st, 2010, Janice Cher Desjarlais and her boyfriend crawled into a dumpster located behind The Center of Hope on Franklin Avenue in Fort McMurray. Janice's boyfriend advised that he left at approximately 7:30 a.m. to go to McDonald\u2019s restaurant. When he returned at around 8:30 a.m., Janice was gone. When he was unable to find her, he suspected that the dumpster may have been emptied during his absence. On October 3rd, video surveillance of the area confirmed that the dumpster had been picked up at 8:22 a.m. on October 1st. It also showed the departure of Janice's boyfriend, but no one else entering or leaving the dumpster. On October 5th, a major excavation of the landfill was started, but by the time the search was completed on October 14th, Janice had not been located.",
