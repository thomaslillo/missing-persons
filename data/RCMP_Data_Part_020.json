By the time they left there were already waves forming as they started out across the lake. The wind increased and the waves were so strong that they would almost cause the vessel to flip over.

The group had planned to go out onto James Bay with the tide and sail to Moosonee by lashing their canoes together. An intense storm engulfed the James Bay coastal area on July 23, 1984, and it is likely that the party perished on the Bay during this storm.
