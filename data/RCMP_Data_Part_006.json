This man reported sharing an intimate relationship with Belinda outside of his own marriage.  He said she was not a habitual runaway.  This man denied harming Belinda and through a Polygraph examination was determined to be honest.  The Victoria Police investigated Belinda's disappearance and determined that Belinda suffered from a mental illness, had a drug addiction and may have been a sex trade worker.  The last confirmed sighting of Belinda was at Shoppers Drug Mart at 870 Esquimalt Rd.  She failed to attend thereafter to pick up her daily medication.",

On June 20, 1967, two of the three canoes became stranded on mud flats at a point where the Hayes and Nelson Rivers empty into the Hudson Bay. The men made camp for the night and then the following day Kurt Hild, Ronald Davidson and James Cochrane all attempted to retrieve the stranded canoes. On return to the camp the men were confronted with high winds and freezing rain which forced them out of sight. None of the remains of the men have been recovered. Foul play is not suspected in the matter.",
