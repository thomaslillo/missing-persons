They attempted to swim to Deer Island but the current and the waves carried them to 1/4 mile east of Deer Island. The bundle of logs that they had tied broke and the men were separated. Mr. Stackhouse's friend managed to swim to Deer Island but he did not see Mr. Stackhouse again. Searches of the area were done by land, air and water but the body of Mr. Stackhouse was not recovered.
