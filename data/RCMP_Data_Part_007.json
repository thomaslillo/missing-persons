A search was initiated and police found a boat submerged upright on the bottom of the lake. The depth of the lake around the boat was only 8 to 10 feet deep. It appeared to Police that the men encountered extremely rough water while crossing Moose Lake. The motors were both found to be in forward gear. There was no floatation gear in the boat and it was heavily loaded with camping and hunting equipment. All of the bodies were recovered with the exception of M. Garson. It is presumed Mr. Garson drowned.",
