Mr. Gorrie followed the patrol boat for some time and eventually the family boarded the patrol boat while Mr. Gorrie continued to follow in his boat. Both vessels proceeded west however after a time, the height of the waves increased (7 to 8 ft.). As a result the patrol boat had to increase power, which substantially increased the distance between the respective boats. Mr. Gorrie's boat was last seen a 1/2 mile behind the patrol. Immediate searches by air provided negative results. It is presumed that Mr. Gorrie drowned as he or the boat have never been located.",

His post-mortem weight was recorded as being 113 lbs, however this measurement may not represent his actual living weight due to post-mortem changes noted at autopsy. He had signs of having suffered an acute or chronic right lung infection. He is estimated to have been dead for several months. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts this unidentified male is either of European ancestry, or South Asian ancestry, or mixed European and South Asian ancestry.",
