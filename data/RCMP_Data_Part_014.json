A man matching Kelvin's description was seen walking on the road at 7:30 am on the 17th of June. An extensive search by land, air and water proved negative. Kelvin did not take his wallet, money or any identification to the cabin and had no means of transportation. Mr. Zdarski has not been seen or heard from again.",
