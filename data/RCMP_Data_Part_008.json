His post-mortem weight was recorded as being 200 lbs, however, this measurement may not represent his actual living weight due to post-mortem changes noted at autopsy. He is described as balding, however, due to the length of time spent in the water, it is possible that his hair was lost after death giving the appearance of male pattern baldness. He is uncircumcised. His appendix is present. Changes to his heart suggest that he had high blood pressure and may have been treated for this. It is believed that he was in the water for days to weeks prior to his discovery.",
